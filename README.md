# The Q# Programming Language
## My Code Samples

I'm surprised to see that Q# is much more developed than it was 2 years ago when I first tried it out. So I decided to devote some time coding with it.

I had fun.

Summary of the folders:

+ Basic: Me trying to write my first runnable standalone Q# program, with VS Code Editor, using the Q# plugin.

+ Hello: Hello world program.

+ Random Number: A sample program from the official Q# site. This is a random number generator program.

+ CodeForces Contest 2020W: Me trying to solve the problems of the 2020 CodeForces Q# Contest Warmup Round.

+ CodeForces Contest 2020F: Me trying to solve the problems of the 2020 CodeForces Q# Contest Formal Round.
